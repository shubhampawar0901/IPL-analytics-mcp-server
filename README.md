Q: 1
IPL Analytics MCP Server
Overview
Develop an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides intelligent SQL querying capabilities for the Indian Premier League (IPL) database, enabling natural language queries to be converted into SQL and executed against a comprehensive cricket analytics database.

Problem Context
Dataset Specifications
Database Type: SQLite
Source: Kaggle IPL Database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harsha547/ipldatabase/data)
Coverage: 577 matches across seasons 2008-2016
Players: 469 detailed player profiles
Schema Complexity: 15+ interconnected tables with rich relationships
Key Database Entities
Based on the schema diagram, the database contains:

Core Match Data:

Match details (venue, date, teams, outcomes)
Ball-by-ball data with detailed events
Toss decisions and match results
Player Information:

Comprehensive player profiles (DOB, batting/bowling styles)
Performance statistics and career data
Team affiliations and roles
Geographic & Venue Data:

City and country information
Venue details and match locations
Game Mechanics:

Wicket types and dismissal methods
Batting and bowling styles
Umpire and official information
Primary Challenge
Cricket analysts, sports journalists, data scientists, and IPL enthusiasts need to extract complex insights from this rich dataset, but they face several barriers:

Technical Barrier: Users must know SQL syntax and understand the complex relational schema
Domain Knowledge Gap: Understanding cricket terminology and statistical relationships
Query Complexity: Multi-table joins and aggregations required for meaningful insights
Time Inefficiency: Manual SQL writing for exploratory data analysis
Develop an MCP server with the following capabilities:
Natural Language to SQL Translation
Convert cricket-specific queries into optimized SQL
Handle complex aggregations and multi-table joins
SQL Agent Tools
query_player_stats: Player performance analytics
match_analysis: Match-level insights and comparisons
team_performance: Team statistics and trends
season_comparisons: Cross-season analysis
head_to_head: Team vs team historical data
Domain-Aware Query Processing
Understand cricket terminology (strike rate, economy, etc.)
Handle IPL-specific concepts (powerplay, death overs)
Recognize player names, team names, and venues
Sample Queries
"Compare team performance in home vs away matches"
"Find the most successful bowling combinations."
"Historical head-to-head performance between CSK and MI"
"Most impactful players in playoff matches"
"Best performing players against specific teams"
"Consistent performers across different match situations"
"Player form analysis over recent matches"
MCP Server Implementation
Language: Python with SQLite integration
Tools: Custom SQL agent tools for domain-specific queries
NLP: Query understanding and SQL generation
Optimization: Query performance
